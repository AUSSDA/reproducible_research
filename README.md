# Open Science and Reproducible Research 
  

Welcome to the Open Science and Reproducible Research Course! This course is designed to introduce learners to the ideas of Open Science and Reproducible Research, and to give them a hands-on introduction into tools that facilitate open and reproducible workflows.

You can start the course via this link: [https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUSSDA/reproducible_research/refs/heads/main/open_science_reproducible_research.md](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUSSDA/reproducible_research/refs/heads/main/open_science_reproducible_research.md)

## Description

The course is structured as a stand-alone online self-study module created with LiaScript. It is suited for researchers of all levels and experiences, and discipline-agnostic, although examples are geared towards members of the Social Science community. 

The course covers the following topics:

* What is Open Science?
* What is reproducible research?
* Challenges of an solutions for collaboration
* GIT – working collaboratively and version control
* Quarto, R-Studio: one tool for your theoretical and empirical work 
* APIs and the renv package

Reproducible research covers a set of practices that are rooted in the idea of Open Science. By taking this course learners will learn how to think about their research practices in ways that foster reproducibility - for themselves, and others. Increased collaboration, more efficiency and - ultimately - better research are tangible benefits from practicing reproducible research.

## How to (Re-)Use the Course

The online modules are written in LiaScript, a Markdown dialect, making it convenient to customize them for your research institution. For assistance, please refer to the LiaScript documentation.
